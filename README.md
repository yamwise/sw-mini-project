# sw-mini-project
software mini project for ec463 at BU

The main objective of this project was to learn how to use REST APIs, create our own REST API, and to utilize a cross-platform environment (react-native, expo) to build a mobile application. Other objectives included working effectively using Github and Agile software development strategies.

The application returns the number of calories per serving in a food based on its barcode. The app uses the smartphone's camera to scan the barcode and fetch information from the FDC API, which contains information about food items. Using Google Firebase, the information for the user is stored and can be fetched whenever the user wishes to review their recently scanned foods.
